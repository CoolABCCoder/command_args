# command_args
Class on C++ for processing command line arguments

PREFACE

Command line programms receive their parameters through command line. For example, utility GREP (http://www.computerhope.com/unix/ugrep.htm) can take great many parameters. There is a library for processing parameters in Linux. But port that library in windows for your own project is not quite simple. Besides, it is C-oriented, and you'd like to have a C++ class for this purpose, wouldn't you? This purpose is enabled in proposed class.
